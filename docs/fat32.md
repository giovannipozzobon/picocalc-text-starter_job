# FAT32

The FAT32 driver implements the FAT32 file system commonly used on SD cards. This driver does not support FAT 12 or FAT 16 file systems. One draw back to this is that cards 4 GB or less may be formated with FAT 16 by default, which this driver will be unable to read.

This driver is designed to be used with the [SD Card](docs/sdcard.md) driver, which provides the low-level access to the SD card. The FAT32 driver uses the SD Card driver to read and write sectors on the SD card.

## fat32_is_ready

`bool fat32_is_ready(void)`

Returns true if the SD card is initialised, mounted, and ready to use.


## fat32_mount

`fat32_error_t fat32_mount(void)`

Returns FAT32_OK if successful, otherwise an error code is returned.


## fat32_unmount

`void fat32_unmount(void)`

## fat32_is_mounted

`bool fat32_is_mounted(void)`

Returns true if the SD card is mounted.

## fat32_get_free_space

`fat32_error_t fat32_get_free_space(uint64_t *free_space)`

Returns the free space on the SD card. If available, the estimated free space is returned, otherwise the free space is computed, which may take many seconds.
